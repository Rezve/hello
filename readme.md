# Hello - Experimentation Repository

Welcome to the **Hello** repository! 

This is a place where I store experimental code, prototypes, and ideas that I explore as I work on improving my skills and learning new techniques in software development.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a space for:

- Trying out new technologies, libraries, and frameworks.
- Storing solutions to software problems I've explored.
- Learning and improving without the pressure of production-level code.
- Sharing ideas with the community and getting feedback.

## Structure

Each experiment is in its own folder. The basic structure looks like this:

```
/hello
    /experiment_1
    /experiment_2
    /experiment_3
    ...
```

Each experiment usually contains:
- The code for the experiment
- Notes or documentation on what the experiment is about
- Any setup or configuration instructions

## Setup new Node.js project

```bash
yarn init
yarn add @types/node typescript nodemon ts-node -D
npx tsc --init
```

## Contributing

While this repository is mostly for my personal use, you're welcome to contribute! If you have ideas, improvements, or want to share your own experiments, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

This is an experimentation space, so the code might not be production-ready. Expect incomplete features or non-optimal solutions, as the goal is to learn and explore.

Thanks for checking out my repository, and happy coding!
