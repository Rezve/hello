# AI Experiments

This folder contains various experiments related to artificial intelligence.

## Experiments

1.  [chat-session](https://github.com/Rezve/hello/tree/main/ai/chat-session) This repository contains a simple experiment where I tested session-based chatting with a large language model (LLM). The goal is to maintain the full conversation in memory and pass it back and forth.

2. [embeddings](https://github.com/Rezve/hello/tree/main/ai/embeddings) This is a test project designed to explore how embeddings work. The goal of this project is to:
    - Feed custom data.
    - Ask questions and receive answers from the custom data.

3. [tools-calling](https://github.com/Rezve/hello/tree/main/ai/tools-calling)
